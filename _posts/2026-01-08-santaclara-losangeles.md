# Preserving

[MLSys]() is one of the better Machine Learning conferences in my opinion. Some really good papers and posters covering indepth, practical aspects of scaling up / making ML systems more efficient at train and inference time.

It also happens to be on the west coast each year so this year I tagged a bit of a bucket list trip onto it..

# Goal

Tackle a decent chunk of the Pacific Coast Highway (PCH). A lot of people drive the PCH, fewer people cycle it and fewer again hike it. The segment I planned to cycle spans some of the most beautiful parts of the US pacific coast and the range is unbeatable - Silicon Valley to San Francisco, out into the wilderness / old California and finally ending up in the sprawling metropolis that is Los Angeles.

I hadn't cycled at all in the states before and was a bit wary of the road manners I would encounter - opinions online ranged from "no problem" to "never ever again"..

# Day 1: Santa Clara to Santa Cruz via San Francisco

Day 1 was a strange start. I had spent the previous five days immersed in AI/ML at the Santa Clara Convention Center (usually the epicentre of the annual NVIDIA love-in) and so I hadn't really been thinking about cycling at all. I assembled my touring bike and gear in my hotel room (don't know what the cleaners thought about this!) and spent a couple of nights faffing with the brakes which would just not stop rubbing, adjusting saddle height. 

Finally we're ready to go. I head down to breakfast - sickly sweet muffins, fruit loops, those weird waffles / pancakes you pour yourself into the griddle, tons of bad american coffee. This type of breakfast was to be a feature of this trip!

The last thing I had to do was throw all my clothes into the trash! I could only carry a small amount and had packed lots for the conference itself. As I hurled the full suitcase into the skip at the back of the hotel, again I could only wonder what the cleaning staff were going to make of all this. Later, I realised I had thrown my house keys from the UK away too, when I got back to Cardiff!

And we're off! Dry and sunny, a bit cool. I meandered through top-class cycling infrastructure sponsored by Google and Meta. Stopped at 1 Hacker Way to get a picture of the old Sun Microsystems sign, then pushed on to San Francisco. Dodged the lemming tourists to get my obligatory pic at the Golden Gate bridge, then through the Presidio and onto the coast road proper.

240km and 1650m elevation today, but didn't feel like that at all - everything was so interesting and new..


# Day 2: Santa Cruz - Carmel by the Sea - Monterey

[Day 2 Strava link](https://www.strava.com/activities/14512813628)

Day 2 starts poorly - my hotel doesn't do breakfast. I've still got some jelly babies from yesterday so they do to get started then pick up breakfast in a McDonalds. In general on this trip when I see a McDonalds I go in and have something - the food is shit but you know what you're going to get. When you're burning 4,000+ calories per day on the bike a gentle "between" snack is a Big Mac meal!

Carmel by the Sea is a bit twee for my liking but nice enough. I used to work in SF and it seems familiar to me - maybe I was here for a day all those years ago? It's hilly to get into and out of though, and I know I've got a big day tomorrow (little did I know!) so I head for Monterey and my hotel for the night.

# Day 3: Monterey - Paso Robles

[Day 3 Strava link](https://www.strava.com/activities/14524533005)

Today was always going to involve tacking inland. The PCH has been closed for a couple of years due to a massive landslide. The coastal geography and how they've built Route 1 dictates this.


In Paso Robles, my hotel is really nice. I'm absolutely f**king knackered so run a hot bath just to lie in for an hour. Eat my weight at dinner and then a good night sleep.

# Day 4: Paso Robles - Cambria - Harmony - Cayucos - Morro

[Day 4 Strava link](https://www.strava.com/activities/14532573121)

A short day today but the climbs and descents - wowzers! Getting back on the coast from Paso Robles is a real treat - a decent climb but on smooth tarmac and the vistas down to the coast are awesome. Lots of roadworks but nothing to hold me up really. At the coast I could have turned right to go up to the landslide but I just can't be arsed. Lunch at Cayucos, then push on to Morro. Another dry, sunny day - just like every day so far on this trip, blessed.. To cap it off, got a beautiful picture of the sunset in Morro Bay..

# Day 5: Morro - Pismo Beach - Guadalupe - Orcutt - Lompoc

[Day 5 Strava link](https://www.strava.com/activities/14544326017)

After another sugar-filled breakfast, it's time to hit the road.

# Day 6: Lompoc - Gaviota - El Capitan - Goleta - Santa Barbara - Ventura

[Day 6 Strava link](https://www.strava.com/activities/14555686735)

The goal for today.

# Day 7: Ventura - Malibu - Santa Monica -Hollywood - Los Angeles. End of tour!

[Day 7 Strava link](https://www.strava.com/activities/14565559641)

Last day and I'm gutted! This has been a trip to remember, for all the right reasons.

The goal is the Hollywood sign vista point which is miles away from the sign itself. I want this photo to go with the one I got in San Francisco at the Golden Gate bridge as two book-ends for the trip..

Motored on making good time. The PCH is busy again here - quite built-up but also safe due to the wide margin / hard shoulder. Miss my turn-off at Santa Monica and my nav goes mad for a while. Eventually a quick sprint down a one-way street sees me right and we're back on track for the Hollywood. All of a sudden we're in LA! I spot my first Waymo. Traffic quite dicey now and it's every man for himself. I take up a dominant position in the middle of the road to avoid being squashed and push on. Then it quietens down when I get to Beverly Hills / West Hollywood. Then I realise it's actually a belter of a climb up twisty roads to get to my end goal. Buckle down and get on with it - that picture isn't going to take itself. After a sweaty 20 minutes I'm there. A 500m walk in cleats to get the perfect picture and the tour is all but over. What a trip. A short 15km back into Koreatown in LA to my hotel and an end-of-tour 4 course meal. Job jobbed.
